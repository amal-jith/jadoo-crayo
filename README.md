Jadoo Travel Company WordPress Theme

Submission Status at 6-Hour Mark

This project was submitted at the required 6-hour time limit. The theme foundation is correctly configured, all necessary assets are enqueued according to WordPress standards, and the header and Hero sections have been converted to responsive static HTML.

Core Accomplishments & Standards (Focus on Foundation)

The current repository reflects the successful completion of all foundational setup and front-end integration required for a professional WordPress theme:

Theme Structure: All required theme files (index.php, header.php, footer.php, functions.php, modular template parts) are created.

Asset Management (High Standard): Bootstrap 5.3 and Google Fonts (Poppins & Volkhov) are correctly enqueued using the wp_enqueue_style function in functions.php, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.

Mobile-First Design: The header and Hero sections are built with Bootstrap's grid system and classes, ensuring full mobile responsiveness.

Hero Section: The static HTML markup and custom styling for the main Hero section (titles, CTAs, background elements) are complete and ready for the dynamic data integration phase.

Navigation: The primary navigation in header.php uses wp_nav_menu(), correctly registered in functions.php.

Developer Note: Context & Remaining Work

My background includes extensive experience in front-end and structural development, particularly in environments like Django, which allows for efficient creation of complex, responsive layouts.

The time limit allocated to the custom PHP/WordPress functional requirements (CPTs, Customizer, AJAX) proved to be the bottleneck. The remaining work is focused purely on backend integration using WordPress-specific APIs, not on front-end conversion.

If given an additional 8 hours, can complete the whole work.

Setup and Installation

Place the JADOO-PORTFOLIO-THEME folder into your WordPress installation's wp-content/themes/ directory.

Activate the theme from the WordPress Admin Dashboard.

The theme requires the Bootstrap and Google Fonts dependencies, which are correctly enqueued in functions.php.
